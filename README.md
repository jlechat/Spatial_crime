# Spatial_crime

This is our production for the course "Physique appliqu√©e aux sciences sociales". You can find all our code and how our github is structured below.

## Schelling models:
"code_schelling_1" contains the code to simulate crime in a city according to the basic Schelling model (3 states : low, medium, high).
"code_schelling_2" simulate crime with 9 different states and the attractivity of a house decreases as fast as it increases in case of crime.
"code_schelling_3" simulate crime with 9 different states but the attractivity of a house increases faster in case of a crime than it decreases otherwise.

If you want to see the animation, please dowload streamlit package and execute "streamlit run + file" in anaconda (as indicated in every file).

Only the firt code is commented with details (as the orthers are similar).

## Short model:
In the file "code_short" you can find all the code about the Short model which is discribing in the paper.
